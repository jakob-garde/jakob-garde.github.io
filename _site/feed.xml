It is surprisingly fun and satisfying.</p>

<p>Here’s my baselayer project - many such projects exist out there - and this one is what I have come up with so far. At some point I discovered 
the existence of custom memory allocators, custom buffers and length-based strings, and started writing my own versions. Some of the code 
was collected in homebrew libraries (<a href="https://github.com/climbcat/baselayer">baselayer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/climbcat/cbui">cbui</a>).</p>

<p>Such “baselayer” libraries provide basic utilities for effective programming in a small language like C. It feels luxurious to have light-weight
tools at hand, not having to worry about installing and linking gigabytes of helper libraries, or reading monolithic APIs, just to do 
relatively basic and normal things.</p>

<p>The concept of header-only libraries seemed well worth copying. Using “unity build”, the entire program is statically compiled from source.
Code is organized in .h files, meaning the headers and implementations are found in the same place. This is already standard practice in 
most languages - so why not?</p>

<p>A rudimentary CMake config file in included, for linking convenience in the cases where this is needed, and for seamless integration with certain tools.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="code" /><category term="project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever written a pointer-hash map?

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

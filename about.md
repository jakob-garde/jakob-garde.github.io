### Jakob Garde

Software and systems developer with over 15 years of experience. Passionate about game engines,
custom data structures, and writing effective and performance-aware code in C/C++.

Originally graduated in physics, I discovered my strength in software development, focusing  on low-level data processing, 
system-level software, hardware integration and simulation. Over the years I have developed 3D scanning tools and algorithms, 
sea chart visualization, desktop applications, low-level communication infrastructure and CLI's.

Some of my code is posted [on github].

### Jakob Garde - R&D Software Developer

Software and systems developer with over 15 years of experience.

Originally graduated in physics, I discovered my strength in software development, focusing on simulation and data processing. Today, I have a particular passion for systems programming and performance.

Over the years many things were developed, see my [linkedin] for details.


### Re-inventing the Wheel

Recently I had the exciting opportunity to work independently and develop new skills (AKA being unemployed).
For a tech-focused person like me, the hours are easy enough to fill, but that is only half the job.

The other half being presentation and out-reach, the mysterious "human factor". Please feel free to reach out if you find some of this stuff interesting,
and we may have a coffee/beer/glass of water and talk about what's down in tech in the Greater Copenhagen/Malmö Metropolitan Area.

But why re-invent the wheel?

The best way to learn about wheels, is to build them, and our industry sure has a lot of wheels.
However there is also the chasis, windows and steering, and putting it all into a cohesive whole.

The write-ups are hopefully targetting both the technical and the less techincal reader, because who reads raw, self-documenting code in 2025, anyways.

Project source code is posted [on github].
